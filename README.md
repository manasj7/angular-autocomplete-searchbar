## Using the Angular CLI to setup an Angular Application

To see these concepts in practice, first create a new empty folder on your machine to store your first angular app and switch over to VSCode and open the folder created.

Install the Angular CLI globally `npm install @angular/cli -g`, the Angular CLI is a tool which makes it easy to create new angular applications, setting up the development environment and also assisting in common angular tasks like creating new components or services.

Create a new angular project by the command "ng new" followed by the "name-of-the-app" `ng new books-app`.

When the setup is done navigate into the app folder by using the command `cd books-app` in the terminal window. Then, use the command `npm install` to get the required dependencies and we are ready to run the application with the CLI command `ng serve`. The server will be started and the app will be available locally on port 4200 (http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Within the src folder, we find the file index.html which is the html shown in the browser. The file contains a simple HTML boilerplate, and the body of this HTML consists of nothing more than a custom tag called app-root.

app-root refers to the root component which is found in the "src/app" folder. The component is called here app component and the main file is "app.component.ts". This file contains the controller class which is basically just an ordinary TypeScript class but with metadata attached through a class decorator. The selector 'app-root' is used to include the component in an HTML file, in a case of the root component, we saw it was included in the index.html file. And we have references to the HTML template and CSS stylesheet belonging to the component.
